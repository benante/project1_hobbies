            <h3>Coding</h3>
            <p>
                I started to learn in 2020, being influenced by a good friend of mine.At the time I worked in a
                brewery and wasn't really happy about it so I decided to give it a go and I loved it straight away!

            <h3>Swimming</h3>
            <p>
                It' s only recently that I discovered my passion for swimming. I have been swimming for the past 3 years at least twice a
                week and I love everything about it: the tranquility of the water, the breathing, the different techniques.

            <h3>Playing guitar</h3>
            <p>
                I grew up listening to music since a was a little kid and I loved rock music so much I ended up in a
                band, for 7 years! I was the singer and rythm guitarist, best time of my life!Nowadays I still play when
                I want to relax.
